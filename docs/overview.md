## Overview

This site is an exploratory analysis that seeks to model the economic impact of sea level rise (SLR) on the city of Miami. To read the main study, you can continue to the [introduction](pages/analysis/00.introduction.md) page of the analysis section.

## Methodology

We attempt to use both qualitative and quantitative methods for the analysis. You can find all code in the [MiamiLost](https://github.com/miamilost) GitHub Organization. More information on individual repositories is available on the [documentation](pages/resources/02.documentation.md) page. If you find an issue with the methodology please submit a [GitHub]() issue, or start a thread on the GitHub [discussions]() page and we will attempt to address it (time permitting).
