## Methodology

We attempt to use both qualitative and quantitative methods for the analysis. You can find all code in the [MiamiLost](https://github.com/miamilost) GitHub Organization. More information on individual repositories is available on the [documentation](../../pages/resources/02.documentation.md) page. If you find an issue with the methodology please submit a [GitHub]() issue, or start a thread on the GitHub [discussions]() page and we will attempt to address it (time permitting).
